This is the simple IoT game *ShakeIT*, used as a IoT showcase in the thesis "Developement of an IoT showcase with a didactic concept".\
There are 3 repositories for this: 
- [Backend](https://github.com/steffimo/backend)
- [User Frontend](https://github.com/steffimo/iotgame)
- [Analyse Frontend](https://github.com/steffimo/analysis)

If you're interested in the content of the thesis, here's the abstract:\
Digitalization brought the concept of the "Internet of Things" (IoT) as a central concept into circulation and everyday life in both industry and the private sector. But what is behind it?\
This work is intended to provide insights into the background of the Internet of Things. Using a developed model, typical IoT components and data flows were realized, which can also be traced back to common architectural patterns. The project is based on the requirements of developing an application that has simple structures and can be implemented cost-effectively.\
As a showcase, this model can be used in all areas for education, training and further education. In particular, it is also intended to lay a foundation for sensitization in form of data maturity and data awareness.\
As an example, this model was evaluated with a didactic concept for a workshop designed for pupils from the upper school of the Bavarian Gymnasium.

---The thesis will be published soon, so that here'll gonna be the link ---
